## Description

This dashboard helps the Titanic survival prediction .

Passengers in different age groups had different survival rates. The survival rate was highest for passengers between 0 and 20 years old, and lowest for passengers between 60 and 80 years old. This could be due to a number of factors, including the fact that younger passengers were more likely to be able to swim and evacuate the ship quickly, and that older passengers may have had underlying health conditions that made it more difficult for them to survive in the cold water.
Women were more likely to survive than men. The survival rate for women was nearly double the survival rate for men. This is likely due to the fact that women and children were evacuated from the ship first, according to the "Women and children first" protocol.
Passengers who traveled in First Class were more likely to survive than passengers in other classes. The survival rate for passengers in First Class was over 60%, while the survival rate for passengers in Third Class was less than 20%. This is likely due to the fact that passengers in First Class had better access to lifeboats, as they were located closer to the First Class cabins.
Passengers who boarded the ship at Cherbourg had a higher survival rate than passengers who boarded at other ports. The survival rate for passengers who boarded at Cherbourg was over 40%, while the survival rate for passengers who boarded at other ports was less than 30%. This is likely due to the fact that the passengers who boarded at Cherbourg were the last to board the ship, and therefore had more time to evacuate the ship before it sank.
The majority of the passengers on the Titanic did not survive. The image shows that there were 288 survivors out of a total of 712 passengers, which means that over 60% of the passengers did not survive. This is a sobering reminder of the tragedy of the Titanic disaster.These insights can be valuable for Afame Technologies to make informed.
